![Skärmbild 2025-03-04 110819](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06ba057-dcb3-4acd-adfb-f711ab4777c4)

### This is my portfolio project for the "Web Development with JavaScript" course, which is the first course in the Frontend Development program with JavaScript and React at Yrkeshögskolan i Borås.
*(Yrkeshögskola = Higher Vocational Education (Yrkeshögskolan) is a post-secondary form of education that combines theoretical and practical studies in close cooperation with employers and industry. Programmes are offered in specific fields where there is an explicit demand for competence.
The project aims to provide a basic understanding of building a simple website and managing data with JSON and JavaScript.)*

#### The portfolio website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Information about work experience and education is fetched from a custom-created JSON file, making it easy to update and manage the content.
#### The project cards are fetched from gitHub API instead of hardcoded. All repos created on my gitHub will appear on the portfolio page automatically except from repos I dont want to show (repos without any added homepage are filtered out).
### Features:

  * Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  * Dynamic loading of work experience and education from a JSON file.
  * Dynamic loading of projec cards with link to repos and project homapge from GitHub API.
  * Simple and responsive design.
  * Dark and light theme

### Project instructions 
The instructions for the project were to create a simple and responsive website following a preset design layout that I could tweak a little bit as I liked.

This was the initial design:

I am happy with the end result of my project but will eventually create a portfoliio with a different design.
