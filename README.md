# Portfolio Project
### This is my portfolio project for the "Web Development with JavaScript" course, which is the first course in the Frontend Development program with JavaScript and React at the University of Bor√•s.

#### The portfolio website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Information about work experience and education is fetched from a custom-created JSON file, making it easy to update and manage the content.

Features:

  - Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - Dynamic loading of work experience and education from a JSON file.
  - Simple and responsive design.

The project aims to provide a basic understanding of building a simple website and managing data with JSON and JavaScript.
